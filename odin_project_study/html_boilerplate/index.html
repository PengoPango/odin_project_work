 <p>Here is where i shall practice my self learning on <strong>web development</strong>. </p>
 <!-- <strong> creates bold lettering, <em> creates italisized lettering. -->

 <p>Most of the learning notes will be written into the coding of this page through "HTML comments" or kept on Discord. 
This learning is being done through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>.
This link opens the destination in the same tab, however the next link will take you to a new tab,<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>.
</p>
<!-- The <a> tag creates a link, but furthermore requires a 'href' + the destination link, for the link itself to work.-->
<!-- you may notice new attributes, 'target' specifies where the link will be opened, you must add '_blank' for it to do this, as it by nature
 is set to '_self' i.e- the same page.-->
 <!-- the 'rel' attribute describes the relation between the current page and linked, the 'noopener' prevents the lnik from gaining access to the webpage you 
  opened from. The 'noreferrer' prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link to it. These tabs add an extra level of security, preventing phishing and tabnabbing.-->
  <p> There are two types of links: 
    <ol>
     <li>Absolute</li>
     <li>Relative</li>
     
    </ol>
